# Interactive Drawing
# Shapes


# This is an overview of the shapes that can be drawn on the
#	canvas. For full details, please look at the documentation.
#	If you are having issues figuring out which shape is drawn
#	by which line of code, try commenting some of them out.
# General notes: It is acceptable to use either () or [] when
#	listing points. However, be careful that you match
#	the number and type of () or [] that you are using. Also,
#	polygons and circles have optional parameters that allow 
#	you to select a fill color.
